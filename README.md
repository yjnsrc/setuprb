#
The `setuprb` script makes sure every machine has the exact same Ruby environment.


### Requirements

Make sure your default shell is `bash`. To check, execute this command:

```bash
$ echo $SHELL    # output should be -> bin/bash
```


### Usage

From your terminal, execute this command:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yjnsrc/setuprb/master/setuprb | sh /dev/stdin arg0 arg1
```


### Notes

Using this script is a pre-requisite to properly running the `tuka` gem.
